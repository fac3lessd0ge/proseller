                <p> To gain access to the game profile, you will need to provide your
				account details, then exit the game and remove it from the
				deviceâ€™s task manager. After the above actions on your part, the
				game values are transferred to your account. Now you can go back
				to your profile. Immediately check the availability of the goods
				you ordered. If after a while the order is still not received,
				then contact our manager to find out the reason. If they wrote
				to you that the order is ready, but the values have not been
				received on your account, contact the manager immediately. </p>
